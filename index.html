          <h3 style="font-size:20;font-family: verdana; color:white;">This website will introduce you to the physics behind that 95mph fastball coming off the mound. We will address the three main forces involved in a baseballs travel and how they effect the movement, speed and direction of the ball. First, we must adress the main charecteristics of a baseball. Gravity, The Magnus Force and many types of drag all contribute to a pitchs movement and speed. Lets Begin!!</h3>

    <h3 style="font-size:20;font-family: verdana; color:white;">Lets begin with adressing some main facts about a baseball. A proffesional leauge baseball weighs between 5 and 5.25 ounces and has a circumference of between 9 and 9.25 inches. This means that the baseballs adverage mass is around 145 grams. With a fastball, the pitches velocity tends to be greater than that of a changeup or curveball.  </h3>

                 <h1 style="size:200%;font-family: fantasy;color:white;"><u>How Gravity affects a speeding baseball</u></h1>
                 <h3 style="font-size:20;font-family: verdana; color:white;">As we all know, the Earths gravity pulls everything toward its core. Well the same is true with the baseball. After being released from the pitchers hand, gravity does what is expected, pulls it down. If we take a curveball for example, it goes up then goes down. The pitcher exerts a force on the ball to cause it to go up, then when it reaches its peak, gravity pulls it down giving the curveball its destictive hook. On the other hand, a fastball is constantly pulled down throughout its travel from the mound. The pitchers mound is elevated causing the pitch to gain speed due to gravity pulling it down therefor giving it downward momentum. This also means that a baseball has acceleration due to gravity!</h3>

                <p style="color:white;font-family:fantasy;font-size: 200%;"><u>How drag affects the  baseball.</u></p>
<p style="font-size:20;font-family: verdana; color:white;">There are many types of drag involved in a baseballs speed and movement. For example, pressure drag and vicious drag play a key role in the speed of a baseball. Drag is known to slow things down, just like air resistance. At speeds below 50mph, the stickyness of air molecules creates a force known as vicious drag. This form of drag slows the ball down and acts like mid air friction in a way. As we build up some more speed, vicious drag no longer plays a role in the balls speed. The frictional forces start to uneven the air pressure areas acting on the ball and form a high pressure zone in front and a low presssure zone behind it. The higher pressure in front wins the pressure battle and implements a new force, pressure drag which also slows it down.</p>

    <p style="color:white;font-family:fantasy;font-size: 200%;"><u>The Magnus Force</u></p>
    <p style="font-size:20;font-family: verdana; color:white;">Up to now, all the forces we have adressed mainly effect the speed of the ball, well thats about to change. The magnus force is the main force that influnces the movement of the baseball. But what is the magnus force?The magnus force is a type of lift that spins a boundary layer of air that clings to its surface as it travels along through the air. Fastballs are only slightly effected by this force while curveballs and sliders are extremly affected by this force.</p>

    <p style="font-size:20;font-family: verdana; color:white;" ><b>1.</b> <a href="http://www.comsol.com/blogs/physics-behind-baseball-pitches/"> Comsol is a great place to find information. </a></p>
<p style="color:white; font-family: verdana; font-size: 20;">I used comsol.com to help me understand the effects of gravity and the magnus force. I think this is credible because the website is up to date, has external links and is written by a credible arthor. I also used this website to understand how the magnus force effects different types of pitches. Author: Andrew Griesmer.</p>

<p style="color:white; font-family: verdana; font-size: 20;">I used howstuffworks.com to understand how the 2 types of drag slow the baseball down throughout its travel. I also used it to clarify that the magnus force opposes gravity. I think that this website is credible becasue it is a newer website and it has external links. Author: William Harris.</p>
